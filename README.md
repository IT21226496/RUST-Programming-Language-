# RUST-Programming-Language-
Year 1 Semester 2 Group project.
Rust is a multi-paradigm and all-purpose programming language created by Graydon Hoare in 2006 while working at Mozilla Research. It focuses on concurrency, type safety, and performance. Rust enforces memory safety without relying on a garbage collector or reference counting. Its borrow checker ensures memory safety and prevents data races during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming and provides access to high-level features, including functional programming constructs. It has gained attention in academic research and has been embraced by major companies like Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft since its stable release in 2014. Rust is valued by developers for its ability to catch subtle defects and enhance team collaboration. It is considered suitable for building efficient and stable operating systems.
